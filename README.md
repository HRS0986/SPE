## Alternative Method

You can also use the app by visiting the following link: [Spex Online](http://spex-app.web.app/). But according to Spotify rules, this app is currently under development mode. It means I have to configure which emails are allowed to use this app. So, if you want to use this app, please contact send your Spotify email to [heshanhfernando@gmail.com](mailto:heshanhfernando@gmail.com). I will add your email to the allowed list.

To bring the app to the production mode, I want 25 active users. So, if you like this app, support me to bring it to the production mode.
